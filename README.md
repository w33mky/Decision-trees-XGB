Using an excerpt from Russian data (RLMS), we predict the occurrence of a  financial failure i.e. when individual financial situation is significantly worsened. 
We control for gender, age, schooling, employment status, engagement in entrepreneurship, place of living (urban vs. rural), health status. 
Note that this exercise has no way of dealing with causality, omitted variable bias or measurement error. If you are willing to go deeper, please, consult a standard econometrics textbook [e.g. Wooldridge (2002)].
